  Dear TripleTen reviewer, please understand I've had one extension and two 1-on-1 Zoom sessions to present all contents provided as it is today -- as suggested by TripleTen Tutors (Mike Lee and Reyhan Merekar). 
  I welcome feedback, but may not be able to provide any further edits -- as I'm truthfully exhausted :/
  Thanks for your understanding.
